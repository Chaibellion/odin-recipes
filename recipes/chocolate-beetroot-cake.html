        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cake my mother made when I was a kid, I dont remember a lot from back then - but I remember this cake. That being said I cannot remember where the recipe was from, so until I can ask my mother if she remembers, I will be using <a href="https://justamumnz.com/2016/12/06/beetroot-chocolate-cake/">this recipe from 'Just A Mum NZ'</a></p>
        <p>Rich and moist cake, never dry, and the beetroot makes the chocolate have more depth.</p>
