        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Its Thai Curry, please do not give me shit for the fact this is not traditional. These recipes are from my mother for a 19 year old kid who has moved out and struggles to feed herself.</p>
        <p>Serves: <em>4 people</em></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Jar of red/green/yellow curry paste</li>
            <li>Rice or rice noodles</li>
            <li>Meat/fish cubed - 100g per person</li>
            <li>Tin baby corn - hung, drained, and quarted.</li>
            <li>1 Cup frozen green beans, or 1 capsicum sliced.</li>
            <li>1 Sliced onion</li>
            <li>1 Can coconut milk or cream.</li>
            <li>1 Dessert spoon cooking oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil kettle for cooking rice, heat oil in pan.</li> <!--Either she was looking down on me, or wanted to be very clear since she knew I could forget. I prefer to think its the latter.-->
            <li>When oil is hot, add 1 heaped DSP curry past and stir.</li>
            <li>Put rice onto boil.</li>
            <li>Add onions, cook 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add coconut milk/cream, stir</li>
            <li>Add veges, cook 5-7 minutes, stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add meat/fish, cook 5 mins max.</li>
            <li>I'm realizing here that my mother tells me to cook the meat for 5 minutes, which would leave it still raw. So please cook the meat/fish first.</li>
            <li>Drain rice, pour over boiling water</li> <!--Is this a sin?-->
            <li>Enjoy!</li> <!--She did actually put this as a step, she does care-->
        </ol>
